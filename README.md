pandemic
========

A helper to the Pandemic boardgame from Z-Man. The app will build and shuffle a virtual player deck, dividing the epidemic cards in equal groups of cards. Each round it will inform the players which type of cards they have to take.

In the physical side of things, the group will shuffle the cards and form separate piles and draw the cards from the correct ones.
